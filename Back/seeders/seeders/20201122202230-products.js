          "Our best-selling wine for many years, “GOC” continues to set the benchmark for dependably delicious Claret. The 2018 vintage produced glorious wines of real depth and body, as shown by this classic Bordeaux blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is rich with pure cassis and bramble fruit, mingled with warm, smoky oak aromas from barrel ageing. On the palate, the succulent blackcurrant fruit is framed by a fine, complex structure, while the finish is rounded, juicy and very moreish. Made for early drinking, it’s suitable for almost any occasion.",

Fermented at low temperatures to preserve the crystalline purity of this popular variety, the nose displays classic cut-grass and gooseberry aromas. The palate follows up with fresh, crunchy white current and citrus fruit. With its elegant, bone-dry finish, this is perfect on its own or with lighter fish and chicken dishes.",

Bright yellow in colour, on the nose it shows floral, citrus and herbaceous notes over a yeasty and mineral background. The finish culminates in a bitterness perfectly in balance with the rich nutty notes. This works beautifully in many cocktails but is more commonly drunk over ice as an apéritif.",

This is a wine that prides itself on its grace and balance rather than pure power alone. Extremely appealing presently but will benefit from a further two years in bottle.",

This is a fine and vivid example of the Bin A single region Chardonnay and will appeal to those who like medium bodied whites which are creamy in texture with lots of minerality. It will drink well on release, but will gain complexity and be more enjoyable after three or four years in the cellar.",

This wine is sourced from various vineyards across the Willamette Valley AVA, with the majority of the grapes coming from biodynamic and organically certified sites. The 2017 vintage was cool and the wine therefore displays floral, jasmine tea and red berry fruit notes, combined with a spiciness on the palate, refreshing acidity and fine-grained tannins. There’s a mineral core that is typical of Old World Pinot Noir. This wine will pair well with hard cheeses and red meat dishes. Drink now to 2027.",

Think of this a little like a “second wine”. It sees a lighter maceration, but is aged exactly like the crus, with 24 months in large old botte. The 2015 has a fine, creamy texture and a deep, satisfying finish.",

I shan’t mince around the euphemisms, there’s oak, lots of it and it delivers this cuvée’s trademark array of decadent aromas magnificently. Come-hither notes of desiccated coconut, toasted walnuts and cheesecake base interplay with a core of black forest fruit so precise and detailed in profile it’s like tasting in high definition. Your palate is the proverbial kitchen of the party where things move up a level with the arrival of mocha, sour cherries, clove and a wisp of menthol freshness. I could continue with sweet tobacco, autumnal leaves and a coquettish damson thing but by now you’ve got the idea. There will be no 2012, 2013 or 2014 904 – pile in. Drink 2020-2050.",

However, in this vintage it has to take a back seat to a number of other cuvees. The final blend was 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc.",

On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and expansive, with a deep core of fruit framed by very fine-grained, velvety tannins, concluding with a sapid, even saline finish. Its concentration without weight, as well as its striking aromatic amplitude, mark it out as one of the finest expressions of Grenache to be found in the United States. The 2015 was cropped at 1.2 tons per acre and saw a saignée of 8% to 15%, and it was fermented with 70% to 80% whole cluster, attaining 14.2% alcohol.",

This compelling, black/blue-hued offering from 75-year-old Syrah vines tastes like blood of the vine. An extraordinary perfume of flowers, creme de cassis, blackberries, roasted meat, new saddle leather, and earth is followed by a wine with sweet tannin, sensational concentration, full body, an unctuous texture, and a full-throttle, tannic finish. Yet it reveals unbelievable elegance and finesse. Too many Euro-centric elitists argue that Australian wines are too rich and over the top, but all of these offerings have been made by someone with great talent and vision who takes the extraordinary ripeness and purity of fruit available from these old vine vineyards and crafts them into wines that are quite European in style ... just richer and denser. The 2002 Astralis is a tour de force. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2025+.",
